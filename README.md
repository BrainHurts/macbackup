Backup Mac User Profiles Easy

This app can be compiled with pyinstaller but I've attached the ZIP in hopes
you can copy and run it without building.

It was built on Catalina so it will work on MacOS versions newer than that,
up to Big Sur at least. 

You must enter an admin password to elevate your privalges to copy
another users folder at the start, then the UI will load.
